.SS RASTER OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d " DPI" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-dpi=" DPI
Resolution of raster artwork.
.TP
.BI \-m " MODE" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-mode=" MODE
Mode for rasterization (default mono).
.TP
.BI \-r " SPEED" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-raster-speed=" SPEED
Raster speed (0-100).
.TP
.BI \-R " POWER" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-raster-power=" POWER
Raster power (0-100).
.TP
.BI \-s " SIZE" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-screen-size=" SIZE
Photograph screen size (default 8).
.SS VECTOR OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-f " FREQUENCY" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-frequency=" FREQUENCY

.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\^\-no-optimize
Disable vector optimization.
.TP
.BI \-V " POWER" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-vector-power=" POWER
Vector power for the R,G and B passes.
If only one power or speed is specified it will be used for all three.
.TP
.BI \-v " SPEED" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-vector-speed=" SPEED
Vector speed for the R,G and B passes.
If only one power or speed is specified it will be used for all three.
.SS GENERIC OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\^\-help
Output a usage message and exit.
.TP
.B \-\^\-version
Output the version number of
.B pdf2laser
and exit.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
In event of success
.B pdf2laser
will return 0 and exit. In event of an error
.B pdf2laser
will print a message to
.B stderr\fR,
return 1 and exit.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
When running
.B pdf2laser
you'll need to specify the
.I ADDRESS
of the laser cutter you are printing to. It is the only mandatory argument.
Most of the other flags have default values but you will want to specify
.I POWER
for both raster and vector as the defaults do not really help very much.
Most of the time when you use
.B pdf2laser
the command call will look like so.

You can consult our wiki for the values to replace those fields with for the
material you are cutting.

When cutting and rastering 1/8th inch birch plywood the call would look as such.

.SH NOTES
Currently if you are at the NYC Resistor space you do not need to specify an
.I ADDRESS
for the laser cutter as it is hard coded.
.B DO NOT COUNT ON THIS FUNCTIONALITY, IT WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE\fR.
